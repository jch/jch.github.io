# Personal project deployment is both harder than easier than ever

Played with kamal for the first time today to deploy my app to a digital ocean droplet. No problems with the interface, but so many layers to the actual machine and a pain to debug at each layer.

Ruby, docker, registry, vm, actual hardware.

Nice that kamal and containers provide an abstraction to where you host.

All this because I didnâ€™t want to jump to the $25/mo render plan for my personal project to boost cpu

It's all setup now at https://jch.app Even on the smallest droplet $4/mo, my heaviest page is 3-4x faster.
