# Monthly finance night

I check our finances on the first of the month. It's frequent enough that I remember what happened in the last month, but infrequent enough to not worry about the details day to day. I use PersonalCapital as an account aggregator so I can get our spending across different accounts. I like to export the CSV because sometimes account syncing breaks or I fat-finger something and lose history. I used to import it into a spreadsheet that has a tab per year, but now keep my own copy in [an app I made](https://jch.app).

* Open up doc with monthly notes
  * Recurring items: pay things not on autopay, one time payments
  * Last month: follow up on notes. e.g. Did locksmith get reimbursed?
  * Current month: write down dates and notes for anything that needs referencing. e.g. 4/1 paid estimated tax $X,XXX
  * Future months: make sections for upcoming items. e.g. December 2025 property tax $X,XXX https://..., October check 401k
* Export transactions from PersonalCapital for the last month
* Import it to [jch.app](https://jch.app)
* Categorize transactions, doesn't have to be perfect, skim categories with big numbers to spot check

My guess is this takes me roughly 10 minutes. I need to login to accounts for payments, skim spending for big things, and write down a few notes for follow up next month.
