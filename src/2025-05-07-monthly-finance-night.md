# Monthly finance night

I check our finances on the first of the month. It's frequent enough for details to be easy to look up, but infrequent enough to be on mind. I use PersonalCapital to aggregate spending across different accounts. I like to export to CSV because account syncing breaks occasionaly or I fat-finger something and lose history. I use [an app I made](https://jch.app) to review spending.

* Open up doc with monthly notes
  * Recurring items: pay things not on autopay, one time payments
  * Last month: follow up on notes. e.g. Did locksmith get reimbursed?
  * Current month: write down dates and notes for anything that needs referencing. e.g. 4/1 paid estimated tax $X,XXX
  * Future months: make sections for upcoming items. e.g. December 2025 property tax $X,XXX https://..., October check 401k
* Export last month's transactions from PersonalCapital, and import it to [jch.app](https://jch.app)
* Categorize transactions, sort / filter / skim for large transactions

My guess is this takes me roughly 10 minutes. I login to accounts as needed, fix miscategorized transactions, and squint to see if anything weird stands out.

For spending categories, I use a few broad categories rather than many granular ones; 'Home' includes mortgage, HOA dues, repairs, property taxes. 'Utilities' includes phone, internet, water, trash, electricity. Last year, the top 3 categories accounted for 75% of our spending, the top 5 for 85%. It's easier to remember fewer categories and consistently label things. Outside of the top categories, there's a 'General Merchandise' category for any one off things. If an expense could be multiple categories like a rental car (Automotive, Travel), I just pick one. Over time, the categories may change (Automotive and Hobby merged to Automotive), but they're similar enough in recent years to highlight big year-over-year changes. If I'm looking for something specific within a broad category, I can filter then search (Utilities, search for T-mobile).

Transfers between accounts are categorized transfers and cancel each other out. Credit card payments are listed to make it easy to look up payment dates, but aren't counted as an expense because individual transactions already cover that. Other transfers include saving for retirement or college.

I keep track of estimated income tax payments, but don't include them in our spending. I want to know how much money we need to cover our expenses, but income tax varies with income. No income, no income tax either. I do include property tax in our spending because that needs to be paid even if we don't earn income.

I track investment dividend dates to help manage our cash flow, making sure we have enough cash on hand for a year of expenses. Cash beyond a year's expenses goes towards a savings goal like retirement or education.

I don't try to distribute big expenses across months. For example, home property taxes and insurance is paid twice a year. It makes those months look heavy in spending, but I'm more interested in 1-year spend, or running 12-month average spending. I don't think it's useful to compare spending month to month, preferring to look at the bigger annual picture (2023 vs 2024).

I like to keep things simple, and this has worked well for me over the years. I have some other notes on personal finance at [jch/personal-finance](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance).
