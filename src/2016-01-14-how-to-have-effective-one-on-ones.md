# How to have an effective one on one

I have half hour weekly one on one meetings with my manager, Dave. We usually
talk about work, life, and career goals. It gives us a time to pause and reflect
on everything at a high level. Before we had started these, it felt
uncomfortable to give feedback to one another without feeling like someone was
in trouble. Having regular and short meetings makes it easy to highlight
achievements before we forget them, and also to bring up concerns before they
grow.

Although we meeting regularly, this doesn't mean we take this time for granted.
I've found that good one on one meetings follow some patterns. I'm still
refining these, but here are a few:

## Write an agenda

I spend roughly 15 minutes preparing a bulleted list agenda for what I want to
talk about the night before the meeting. The list gives Dave a preview of what's
on my mind, and a chance to gather relevant information before our meeting. It's
also useful during the meeting because it gives us an outline to make sure we
forget anything. I usually include:

* review from last week's meeting (I'll talk about this later)
* one sentence about high level accomplishments
* team members that are doing a great job and deserve recognition
* questions, if any
* reminders about upcoming dates, events, personal life items

Here's an example agenda from a recent meeting:

* cloud: continue query scoping work, reviews, parser improvements for long term
* orgs: mostly code reviews, on-boarding new team members, passive maintenance role, wrapping up
* props: rick and arthur for the great work on query parsing
* props: dave, matt, katie, rob for project organization and process
* personal: working over the break was a good time to catch up and recharge technical chops
* personal: following some large scale projects learning: mysql KV store, notification storage reduction, rails upgrades

High level accomplishments are great for sensing if a project feels on track. I
avoid including too many details because it's easy to get sidetracked and spend
the whole 30 minutes talking about details that belong in another conversation.
I summarize and highlight the big points about projects I'm working on (cloud,
orgs), the type of work being done, and sometimes their status.

One of my favorite parts of these meetings is recognizing great work from other
team members. It's an important part of giving others incremental feedback so
they're not in a vacuum about how they're doing until some type of annual
performance review. I like to thank my team mates directly, but it's also good
to have a running summary from these notes.

In this example, I didn't have any questions. I find that when projects are
running smoothly, there aren't many questions. One on ones are a good place to
get a feel about whether many people on a team are having similar questions. But
in those cases, the meeting isn't the best place to give an answer, a public
discussion with the entire team works better.

I save the last part of the agenda for long term things. Things I'm working on
improving, ideas that I'd like to explore, interesting things I've read.

## Take notes

I like to jot down notes during the meeting. They're never exhaustive nor
complete. I usually write down things I find useful or want to think about after
the meeting. Examples include feedback about ways I can improve, feedback about
how my manager could make the project run smoother, and things that are
happening outside of our project that's relevant to my interests. It's a good
time to discover new projects and opportunities. I find that the agenda will
often trigger us to share bits of useful information that would've otherwise
gone unmentioned.

## Call out action items

Before we end a meeting, we save a few minutes to think about what needs follow
up after the one on one. Maybe an idea that was brought up deserves more
research. Or maybe we need to schedule a team on-site. Whatever these may be, we
decide who is responsible, and when it needs to be done.

## Review and follow up

Remember "review" from the agenda? After each meeting, I dump these notes into a
email reply so we can look back on our notes at our next one on one. We can
review whether action items have been completed. This dedicated time for
reviewing is great because we don't have to waste brain cycles during the week
worrying about following up.

## Build a relationship

Dave and I have gotten to know each other better through these one on ones.
Although we get a lot out of these meetings, they feel casual and easy going. We
live in different cities, so most of our meetings happen over video chat, but
when we are in the same place, we like to do go for a walk or have a chat over
coffee.

Learning about the other person's goals and background subtly shapes our
interactions. Over time, we build up our trust in each other, and become more
effective in our day to day work. We get a better sense of the other person's
communication styles, and also what they're looking for.
