# About

I'm a backend engineer at GitHub. I graduated from the University of California,
Berkeley with a degree in computer science. Outside of technology, I enjoy cars,
being outdoors, and hanging out with my family.

This site is a dumping ground for projects and blog posts. It has gone full
circle from a [collection of shell scripts](https://github.com/jch/flacoblog) to
a [full Rails app](https://github.com/jch/whatcodecraves.com), and back to it's
current form of a [collection of shell scripts](https://github.com/jch/jsg).
