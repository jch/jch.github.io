<p>I learned this tip from Seggy and I've explained it to several people
already. If you've fallen in love with Gmail's web interface, then
you're going to love this solution.</p><p>One annoyance I have on my work laptop is switching between work email
and personal email. For the longest time, I suffered with using Apple
Mail for work stuff and Gmail's web interface for my personal mail.  I
hate Apple Mail, and I hate IMAP and all it's syncing headaches.
Gmail's web interface is the exact opposite. It's accessible
everywhere, stays in sync, and has the <em>best</em> search and organizing
features. My dilemna: How can I get my 2 email accounts to be into
desktop applications, but keep that same amazing web interface?</p><p>Enter <a href="http://fluidapp.com/">Fluid.app</a>. Put simply, it's an
application that creates OSX app's from web pages. The generated app
have menulets, so you can replace Google Notifiers. Fluid also lets
you skin web pages with Javascript and CSS if you're inclined.</p><p>After you install Fluid, make sure you download these <a href="http://chris.ivarson.name/goodies/">gorgeous Gmail
icons</a>.</p><p>When you fire up Fluid, fill in the following information:</p><p><img src="../../../../images/fluid-setup.png" alt="fluid setup window"></p><p>Choose one of the icons you just downloaded.  I use orange for
personal mail, and Coupa blue for work email. When you finish, launch
the apps, login to Gmail, and viola!</p><p>Here's what my dock looks like. Note how there's an indicator for the
number of unread messages in my mailbox. Sweet!</p><p><img src="../../../../images/fluid-dock.png" alt="fluid gmail icons in my dock"></p><p><em>Update</em>: Since I told people about my solution, I heard about two
interesting alternatives.  <a href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/">Postbox Inc</a>
is a free program, and <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane App</a> costs
$24.95.  Both of them were amazing apps, but fell slightly short of my
expectations.  They both had very polished UI's, and were both quick
to download and get up and running.  Postbox was immediately out of
the running when I saw that it used POP/IMAP.  Mailplane was a much
more interesting candidate. It's great because it embeds the Gmail
interface in the main window, but gives you OS X menus and drag&amp;drop
functionality.  My favorite features were the screenshot taker and
drag and drop attachments.  It feels more like a native desktop app
than my Fluid solution.  Alas, I couldn't use it because of one minor
pitfall.  Mailplane allows you to have multiple accounts, but you have
to switch between them.  From the looks of it, you can only have one
'active' account at a time.  This prevents me from having my accounts
in separate windows, which is one of my requirements.  I think both of
these apps are probably better than Apple Mail, and they'd be great
apps if you don't mind IMAP, or if you only have a single account.</p>
