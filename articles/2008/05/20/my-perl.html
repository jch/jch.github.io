<p>My first exposure to Perl was near the end of high school when I was
working as a computer assistant at the USDA Forest Service.  I really
can't recall the exact gut feeling Perl gave me at the time, but I
imagine it was a mixture of disgust and delight.  A few years later,
near the end of my undergrad career, Perl came back into my life.
Only instead of a few simplistic scripts, Perl was now the core language
for my job.</p><p>At the USDA, my main duty was to troubleshoot and help out with small
computer problems.  This included plenty of mundane tasks like
cataloging and auditing old unused hardware, reimaging peoples'
laptops and helping people with network issues.  Fortunately, my
super-nice boss Keiko let me have fun tasks like tweak and mess around
with the web templates (my first exposure to CSS), and write and
maintain little scripts.  Mike the IT guy also loaned me his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101058?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=what0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596101058">llama</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596000278?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=what0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596000278">camel</a>
books.  Both of these were written in a very light-hearted and
cheerful tone.  That bit really stuck with me.</p><p>Perl came in the form of a single large file that had the
responsibility of summarizing and publishing journal articles to the
web directories.  I tweaked this file several times, and each time
involved multiple searches to find where I was supposed to make
changes.  The script was laid out like a well organized essay.  It
started with an introduction of all the global variables and
configurations the rest of the script used.  Then it did a lot of
preparation work to do checks and to satisfy assumptions.  This was
followed by paragraph after paragraph of all the tasks that the script
was able to handle.  Finally we concluded with the CGI parameters
parsing and a giant block of conditional logic to dispatch what needed
to be done.  There was comic relief throughout the script in the form
of comments the writer wrote to himself.  I hated reading through it,
but at the same time, I loved the amount of time and effort it saved
everybody.  Instead of a program, I thought of it more as a batch
script of commands with just a sprinkle of glue logic to make it all
come together.  It could've been done cleaner, but there's are
appropriate times for quick and dirty as well.</p><p>That script taught me a width breadth of new and fun things.  My first
encounter with regexps was in Perl, an indispensible tool.  I also saw
closures and used them before I even knew what a closure was.  There
were all these mystical constructs obfuscated by the gross overuse of
implicit hidden variables and inconsistent syntax.  It was like a
riddle that you solved backwards by spying on it's behavior.</p><p>Fast forward 4 years to the end of my Berkeley education.  I work at
RSSP-IT (previously Rescomp).  What's different about this new
situation?  Well, I know more theoretical computer science, and I also
know more software engineering.  I'd also like to think that I've come
a long ways in recognizing good design, and hope that I can mimic and
even come up with good designs on my own.  Perl hasn't changed since
the last time I saw it.  However, instead of a few simple scripts run
start to finish by a cron job, this incarnation of Perl was a decade
of codebase that powered live critical systems.  Here and there I
still see a few scripts that run from start to finish.  But for the
most part, I see large systems with beefy data backends, reusable
modules of logic, and complex dependencies and hierarchies.
Generations of programmers sweat and sticky keyboards have gone into
the code.  The code could probably be plotted on a timeline to chart
our follies and achievements.  DBIx::Class?  Great idea.  Inline html
for cgi scripts?  That was a hiccup and a bad choice.</p><p>All in all though, I continue to feel the same love hate relationship
with Perl.  The funny part is that I love it for it's flexibilty in
usage, but I also hate it for the exact same reason.  I don't think
Perl is my favorite language, but Perl will always have a special
place.  I love the one-liners you can do with Perl.  I love the time
I've spent with the <a href="http://perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a>.  I love
thinking about automating small tasks and finding cute solutions with
Perl.  This doesn't include writing a large maintainable application
in Perl.  That much discipline and structure just doesn't go well with
this language.  Sometimes you see a problem, and you can just
immediately visualize the stream of gibberish syntax to solve it.  You
know it won't be understood by other people.  You know it won't be
maintainable, and someone will hate you in the future for it.  You
know it's a hack.  But you also can't stop smiling, because you know
you're having a good time with Perl.</p><h2>Miscellaneous Stuff</h2><p>Switch control statement in Perl 5.1.10</p><pre><code>given ($^O) {
