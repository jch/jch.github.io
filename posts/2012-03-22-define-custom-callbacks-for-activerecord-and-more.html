<p>Rails ActiveRecord models have a lifecycle that developers are allowed to hook into. But while most of us know about <code>before_save</code> and <code>after_update</code>, there are a few lesser unknown callbacks that are good to know about before you reinvent them. In this post, I'll cover all of the available ActiveRecord lifecycle callbacks, and also show how you can define custom callbacks for normal ruby objects.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-meet-the-callbacks" class="anchor" href="#meet-the-callbacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meet the Callbacks</h2>

<p>The Rails guide for <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html">ActiveRecord Validations and Callbacks</a> is a good starting point for an introduction of the available callbacks and what they do. Most developers will be familiar with the validation and persistence callbacks, so let's start with these</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c1">:before_validation</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:after_validation</span>
<span class="pl-c1">:before_save</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:after_save</span>
<span class="pl-c1">:before_create</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:after_create</span>
<span class="pl-c1">:before_update</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:after_update</span>
<span class="pl-c1">:before_destroy</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:after_destroy</span></pre></div>

<p>The callbacks above are self explanatory and commonly used, but if you're unfamiliar with them, or need a refresher, check out <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html">the Rails guide on the topic</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-around-callbacks" class="anchor" href="#around-callbacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Around Callbacks</h2>

<p>For <code>save</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>update</code>, and <code>destroy</code>, Rails also gives extra helper methods for defining both a before and after save callback at the same time.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you wanted to trigger your own custom callback while a model was being destroyed. You can do so by defining and triggering your own callback as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">SomeModel<span class="pl-e"> &lt; ActiveRecord::Base</span></span>
  define_callbacks <span class="pl-c1">:custom_callback</span>

  around_destroy <span class="pl-c1">:around_callback</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">around_callback</span>
    run_callbacks <span class="pl-c1">:custom_callback</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
      <span class="pl-k">yield</span>  <span class="pl-c"># runs the actual destroy here</span>
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-custom-callbacks-without-activerecord" class="anchor" href="#custom-callbacks-without-activerecord" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Custom Callbacks without ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>Most of the time, your Rails models will be using <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/01/10/activemodel-make-any-ruby-object-feel-like-activerecord/">ActiveModel</a>, but sometimes it makes sense to use a plain old ruby object. Wouldn't it be nice if we could define callbacks in the same way? Fortunately, the callback system is neatly abstracted into <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Callbacks.html">ActiveSupport::Callbacks</a> so it's easy to mix into any ruby class.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># Look Ma, I'm just a normal ruby class!</span>
<span class="pl-k">class</span> <span class="pl-en">Group</span>
  <span class="pl-k">include</span> <span class="pl-c1">ActiveSupport</span>::<span class="pl-c1">Callbacks</span>
  define_callbacks <span class="pl-c1">:user_added</span>

  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">initialize</span>(<span class="pl-smi">opts</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> {})
    <span class="pl-smi">@users</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> []
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>

  <span class="pl-c"># Whenever we add a new user to our array, we wrap the code</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># with `run_callbacks`. This will run any defined callbacks</span>
  <span class="pl-c"># in order.</span>
  <span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">add_user</span>(<span class="pl-smi">u</span>)
    run_callbacks <span class="pl-c1">:user_added</span> <span class="pl-k">do</span>
      <span class="pl-smi">@users</span> <span class="pl-k">&lt;&lt;</span> u
    <span class="pl-k">end</span>
  <span class="pl-k">end</span>
<span class="pl-k">end</span></pre></div>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-other-useful-callbacks" class="anchor" href="#other-useful-callbacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Useful Callbacks</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>:after_initialize</strong> is called right after an object has been unmarshalled from the database. This allows you to do any other custom initialization you want. Instead of defining an <code>initialize</code> method on a model, use this instead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:after_find</strong> hasn't been useful in my experience. I haven't run into a case where I wanted to manipulate documents after a find action. It could potentially be useful for metrics and profiling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:after_touch</strong>. ActiveRecord allows you to <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-touch">touch a record</a> or its association to refresh its <code>updated_at</code> attribute. I've found this callback useful to triggering notifications to users after a model has been marked as updated, but not actually changed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:after_commit</strong> is an interesting and tricky callback. Whenever ActiveRecord wants to make a change to a record (create, update, destroy), it wraps it around a transaction. <code>after_commit</code> is called after you're positive that something has been written out to the database. Because it is also called for destroys, it makes sense to scope the callback if you intend to use it only for saves. Be warned that after_commit can be tricky to use if you're using nested transactions. That'll probably be the topic of another post though.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># call for creates, updates, and deletes</span>
after_commit <span class="pl-c1">:all_callback</span>

<span class="pl-c"># call for creates and updates</span>
after_commit <span class="pl-c1">:my_callback</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:if</span> =&gt; <span class="pl-c1">:persisted?</span></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>:after_rollback</strong> is the complement to <code>after_commit</code>. I haven't used it yet, but I can see it as being useful for doing manual cleanup after a failed transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>While many of our models will be backed with ActiveRecord, or some ActiveModel compatitible datastore, it's nice to see how easy it is to follow a similar pattern in normal ruby without having to depend on Rails.</p>
