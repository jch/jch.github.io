<p>During covid, I ran out of yeast. I tried to make my own sourdough starter from flour and water, but ended up with a hoochy moldy mess.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple years, and my friend Sarah was kind enough to share her starter, idiot-proof care instructions, and a recipe. I named the starter Lemmy, because it was lemon-y fresh.</p>
<p>The first few loaves were edible, but definitely looked "homemade" in the bad way. I started writing down notes on temperature, ferment times, and other observations in a note on my phone. It gave me the warm fuzzies to see and taste each loaf after the string of initial failures.</p>
<p>I made a webpage to <a href="/projects/sourdough">organize my recipe and notes</a>. It also doubles as an offline baking journal. If you want a piece of Lemmy to try to bake your own bread, I'm happy to mail you some.</p>
