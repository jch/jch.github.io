<p>It happens to all developers.  You're stuck in a place where you need
to get dev work done, but you have to use a computer that isn't
meticuously tweaked to all your obscure settings.  You try using your
editor of choice, only to find all your custom keybindings broken and
the backspace not working.  The chair you sit on is too hard.  The
screen is too small, too flickery.  Everything just <em>feels</em> wrong.</p><p>I hate other peoples' computers.  I hate everything about working on
another person's computer.  I hate how it doesn't act exactly like my
computer.  I hate how nothing is where I expect it to be.  I hate not
having M-g mapped to goto-line in emacs almost as much as I hate not
having emacs on a machine!</p><p>I've switched through a lot of different ways of doing things.  The
good bits stick, the less useful stuff gets forgotten.  I definitely
don't think I have my ideal environment set up, but there's definitely
slow incremental progress.</p><h2>Painware</h2><p>Let's start with the simple stuff.  Long development times require a
comfortable setup.  For me, this includes a dual display setup, an
Microsoft ergo-keyboard, and a comfortable chair.  You'd think this
would be common sense, but I only got this setup after extremely sore
forearms and a messed up back during my compilers project.
Specifically, I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Natural-Ergo-Keyboard-4000%2Fdp%2FB000A6PPOK&amp;tag=what0d-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Microsoft
Natural Ergo 4000</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=what0d-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;
margin:0px !important;">, and a beefy
mesh backed chair with lumbar support I got from Costco.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The two computers I use everyday are a 12" iBook G4, and a 24"
Alumninum iMac.   My requirements for computer hardware isn't about
raw number-crunching power.  Instead, I'd much rather have a computer
that's <em>fast enough</em> and doesn't harress me.  Noise is the big one for
me.  I loved my last desktop cause it had just the right amount of
cooling with so little noise that I could sleep a meter away from it
and not hear it being on.</p><p>If I could redo this setup, I would consolidate the two machines into
a single Macbook Pro because it's a pain in the ass to have the same
environment across multiple machines.</p><h2>Operating System</h2><p>I like OS X for it's unix internals and consistent UI and usage
patterns.  I can't use Windows because their shell isn't usable
enough.  I still like Linux for dev work, but I don't like it non-dev
related activities: e.g. web surfing, chat, organization.</p><h2>Tools</h2><ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a> - console window manager</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/abs/HTML/sedawk.html">sed and awk</a> - this
one hasn't stuck yet.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://petdance.com/ack/">ack</a> - After I learn to use ctags better,
this might not be necessary.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, with
<a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">GitX</a> desktop client.</li>
</ul><h2>End Bits</h2><p>As you can see, it doesn't sound like I use that many differet tools.
Just like my software, I like to keep my dev environment simple and
really focus on a core set of functionality.  When it comes down to
it, all I need is <a href="../../../../articles/2008/02/14/customizing-emacs.html">something</a> to <a href="../../../../articles/2008/04/22/emacs-tips.html">write
in</a>, a browser to look up stuff, and a shell to
glue everything together.  More and more, I find myself looking for
hosted solutions to local tools because it's just easier to maintain
and more accessible.</p><h2>External Resources</h2><ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/">Silent PC Review</a> - is a fantastic
site by Mike Chin with extensive tests about computer component
noise and whole systems.</p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2123">Why iBook?</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote a review of my iBook when I first got it years ago.  Going
back and reading it, I feel that all my statements are still relevant.
What's more, my iBook works better than when I first got it!
Complaints that still apply: uneven lighting to LCD, dim LCD.
Definitely not bright enough for outdoor use.  Upgrading HDD made it
slightly louder, but well worth the performance bump.  I might switch
to a macbook at some point, but the iBook is fantastic so far.
<em>Update:</em> Coupa has given me a Macbook.  Maybe I'll write a comparison
review to it someday.
<em>Update:</em> Back to my iBook, tempted to get a Macbook Air or a Pro.</li>
