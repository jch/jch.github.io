<p>Contrary to what you might think, I think insomnia's fantastic.  It
puts me in this limbo state where my mind feels like lead and I suck
at <em>almost</em> everything.  One thing I've found myself to be quite good
at is catching up on Internet.  There was plenty of crap, but I found
a lot of good technical stuff.</p>
<p>For starters, I subscribed to a bunch of new blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.railsgarden.com" rel="nofollow">Rails Garden</a> - he had a <a href="http://www.railsgarden.com/2008/04/01/ruby-on-rails-is-going-down-introducing-cobol-on-cogs/trackback/" rel="nofollow">fun
entry</a>
on <a href="http://www.coboloncogs.org/" rel="nofollow">Cobol On Cogs</a>.  I love the
functional function keys.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/10/rails-rise-fall-and-potential-rebirth.html" rel="nofollow">Jay Fields'
Thoughts</a> - I
forget where I initially heard about the Presenter pattern,
but all the Ruby references to Presenter link to this guy.  Once
you've read and understood the purpose of Presenter, then
<a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2008/7/28/introducing-activepresenter-the-presenter-library-you-already-know" rel="nofollow">ActivePresenter</a>
is an implementation with a very clean declarative syntax.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://railsenvy.com/" rel="nofollow">Rails Envy</a> - I knew of them before as
the funny Ruby on Rails <a href="http://railsenvy.com/tags/Commercials" rel="nofollow">commercials
duo</a>.  I noticed they had
a podcast, so I started listening to that when I go running.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/" rel="nofollow">Stack Overflow</a> - I also
started listening to Stack Overflow.  It's not running music,
but it's pretty darn entertaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>I played with Google Analytics a bit, and noticed a fun bit in my
Apache access logs:</p>

<p>I also had a blast playing with <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a>.  The
docs were clear and well organized.  All the selectors were exactly
what I wanted.  It was easy to chain together what I wanted to do
because of the methods return jQuery objects.  The callbacks were also
intuitive and easy to manipulate... even for a Javascript newbie.</p>
<p>Another library which I fell in love with at first site was
<a href="http://railstips.org/2008/7/29/it-s-an-httparty-and-everyone-is-invited" rel="nofollow">HTTParty</a>.
It really brings me back to my Perl screen scrapping days. (Oh!
WWW::Mechanize) It also linked me to the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/" rel="nofollow">Programmable
Web</a> homepage.  I
didn't really read through what's available, but this is going to be a
great place to prototype mashups.</p>
<p>Seeing all this good stuff made me look for an excuse to write
something to solidify the basics in my head.  The result is a
half-assed mish-mash of Javascript and Ruby ala jQuery and Merb.  I
used Merb instead of Rails because I was too lazy to create a
database.  Surprisingly enough, <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%202.0.html#_merb" rel="nofollow">Passenger supports
Merb</a>
just fine.  I looked at some of the other lighter Ruby web frameworks,
and they were all pretty fun.  I noted that the new
<a href="http://www.whatcodecraves.com/posts/2008/08/06/flaco_crusher/" rel="nofollow">Webgen</a>
installed <a href="http://ramaze.net/" rel="nofollow">Ramaze</a> as a dependency.  Check it out
if you're <a href="http://hyphy.whatcodecraves.com/" rel="nofollow">feeling hyphy</a>.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: This is an inside joke that just won't die)</p>
<p>Speaking of Passenger, the new Railscast <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/122-passenger-in-development" rel="nofollow">episode about
Passenger</a>
along with <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/ask-your-doctor-about-mod_rails" rel="nofollow">nuby on rails'
article</a>
about rstakeout might finally provide a solution to prevent me from
having to restart my server in development whenever I edit a plugin or
a file in the lib directory.  It also clued me into a whole world of
Ruby monitoring systems, the funniest named one being
<a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/" rel="nofollow">God</a>.</p>
<p>I worked a bunch on migrating this blog over to use Webgen.  I'd say
that I'm about 60 or 70 percent of the way there.  I spent most of the
time just reading and enjoying how simple and clear the code was.  I
think I have a good enough grip on enough code that I'd like to write
a few extensions so that I can continue to publish this blog without
any changes to the previous articles I wrote.</p>
<p>I think there was even more <em>stuff</em> I wanted to keep in my head.
Unforunately, a real downside of insomnia is having some, if not most,
of the good stuff leak out.</p>
