<p>I ran into some trouble with getting a good native postgresql driver
installed.  Here are some links and resources I found to be useful.  I
also wrote a <a href="http://www.whatcodecraves.com/posts/2008/02/05/setup_rails_with_postgresql/" rel="nofollow">checklist for bootstrapping a new Rails app with
postgres</a>
as the adapter.</p>
<p>There are several choices for postgresql adapters.  The most active
and up-to-date one appears to be
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-pg/" rel="nofollow">ruby-pg</a>, previously known as
ruby-postgres.  ruby-pr was the one I was using originally, but this
one is non-native and unmaintained.</p>
<p>A good starting point was <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/06/19/installing-ruby-on-rails-and-postgresql-on-os-x-second-edition" rel="nofollow">Robby's 'Installing Ruby on Rails and
Postgresql on OS X 2nd
edition</a>.
<a href="http://shifteleven.com/articles/2008/03/21/installing-postgresql-on-leopard-using-macports" rel="nofollow">ShiftEleven</a>
also had detailed instructions for installing postgresql with
macports.</p>
<p>The exact steps I took that worked for me were:</p>
<pre><code># start postgres on computer start.
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.postgresql83-server.plist

# the ARCHFLAGS is because of Leopard weirdness.
sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install pg
</code></pre>
