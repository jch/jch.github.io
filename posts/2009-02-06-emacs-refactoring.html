<p>While I waited for Coupa customers to be upgraded, I decided to clean
up my .emacs config file.  My .emacs was never a pretty thing to
admire.  Without any restraint, I often added whatever cool code
snippet I came across online.  The file became verbose, redundant, and
a general mess. I set out to make it more modular and easier to
follow.</p>
<p>The first thing I wanted to fix was this really ugly section where I
manipulate the <code>load-path</code> and load my plugins. I created a
convention to install each plugin in it's own folder, and to have a
install hook for each plugin. For example, the ruby plugin looks like:</p>
<pre><code>~/.emacs.d/plugins
  ruby
    ruby.el
    load-ruby.el
</code></pre>
<p>Previously, I added the following 2 lines for every plugin.</p>
<pre><code>(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/plugins/ruby")
(load "load-ruby.el")
</code></pre>
<p>But thanks to the
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LoadPath" rel="nofollow">EmacsWiki</a>, I learned about
<code>normal-top-level-add-to-load-path</code>. In the finished
version, I put the plugin names in a list and iterate over them:</p>
<pre><code>;;; ### Plugin Initialization ###
(setq plugins-to-load
  '("harvey-navigation" "javascript" "dsvn" "ruby" "ido"))

;; add to "~/.emacs.d/plugins/__plugins-to-load__ to load-path
(let* ((my-lisp-dir "~/.emacs.d/plugins")
       (default-directory my-lisp-dir))
  (setq load-path (cons my-lisp-dir load-path))
  (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path plugins-to-load))

;; run the init file for the plugin
(mapcar (lambda (plugin-name)
          (load (concat "load-" plugin-name ".el")))
        plugins-to-load)
</code></pre>
<p>In the process of changing how plugins are loaded, I removed several
plugins that I never used. This lowered my emacs load time by a large
perceptible amount.</p>
<p>My .emacs isn't something I work with very often, but I derived a fair
amount of satisfaction that the next time I need to tweak something,
I'll know it won't suck.</p>
