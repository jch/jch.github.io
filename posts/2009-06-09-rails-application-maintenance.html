    <div class="markdown-heading"><h1 class="heading-element">The Software Maintenance Light</h1><a id="user-content-the-software-maintenance-light" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: The Software Maintenance Light" href="#the-software-maintenance-light"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/images/check_engine.jpg"><img src="/images/check_engine.jpg" alt="check engine light" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></p>
My cute little box car, [Chuck](/images/chucksmall.jpg), came with an
owners manual.  Inside this little book, it lists all the mileage
intervals when Chuck should be serviced.  At 30,000 miles, you replace
the spark plugs, rotate tires, inspect the brakes, etc.  In addition
to these checklists, every 5000 miles Chuck beeps at me and flashes a
maintenance light to warn me that I should replace the engine oil.  As
my car nears 50,000 miles, it never ceases to amaze me that every time
I turn the key, Chuck starts up instantly and runs as well as he did
when I first got him.  I wish software could be as reliable as my car.
Heck, if it's too much to ask for software to be as reliable as a
Toyota, then I wish software could be as reliable as a mid-90's Chevy
Cavalier.  How could it be that an engine that explodes thousands of
times per minute for multiple decades over hundreds of thousands of
miles in all types of unpredictable weather conditions be *more*
reliable than software?  Then it hit me.  Software applications lack
**regular maintenance**.
<p>Even with the best development practices, I feel that many software
projects are missing this concept of maintenance.  Once a feature is
completed, it won't be touched again until a) the feature breaks, or
b) requirement changes affect the feature.  There doesn't seem to be a
holistic look at the entire app to make sure there aren't future
problem spots.  Going back to the car analogy, when you go for regular
maintenance, the entire car is checked over to identify future problem
spots so you don't have an unexpected catastrophe on the road.</p>
<p>So like Chuck's owner's manual, I propose the following "Software
Maintenance Schedule":</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Always</h2><a id="user-content-always" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Always" href="#always"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Anytime code is changed, no matter how seemingly innoculous the change
is, there is room for error.  These tasks should be run whenever you
touch the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li>run all your tests - check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" rel="nofollow">continuous
integration</a>.
For Ruby, I've tried out <a href="http://integrityapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Integrity</a> and
<a href="http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/" rel="nofollow">CruiseControl rb</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Daily</h2><a id="user-content-daily" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Daily" href="#daily"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The daily tasks are ones that are too bulky to run per file save.
They're good for ensuring the consistency of the entire system.</p>
<ul>
<li>backup the codebase and production data to a secure offsite location</li>
<li>run regression tests</li>
<li>fix hoptoad errors - for large problems, file it into your ticketing system.</li>
<li>deploy code to staging environments</li>
</ul>
<p>I like to have the staging environment closely reflect the actual
production environment.  In fact, the ideal way is to have the staging
environment be cloned nightly from production.  Take care to scrub out
sensitive information so you don't accidentally mass email your live
production users ;)</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Weekly</h2><a id="user-content-weekly" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Weekly" href="#weekly"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>The end of the week is a good time to step back from coding and admire
your team's handiwork.  Unfocus your eyes, take your hands off the
keyboard and just make sure you wrote what you actually intended.</p>
<ul>
<li>release into production</li>
<li>refactoring - spend an afternoon with snacks and drinks and comb over TODOs, OPTIMIZEs, and FIXMEs.</li>
<li>evaluate metrics and analytics to identify performance and potential problems</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think releasing into production weekly is for everyone, but I
do believe that keeping your stable production codebase closely in
sync with your stable development codebase is a good way to keep
production bugs from queueing into a nasty long list.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="http://www.hoptoadapp.com/" rel="nofollow">Hoptoad</a> and <a href="http://www.newrelic.com/" rel="nofollow">New Relic
RPM</a> are a great way to be notified about
potential future problems.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Monthly</h2><a id="user-content-monthly" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Monthly" href="#monthly"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<ul>
<li>test a deployment from scratch</li>
<li>clear out crufty data - old sessions, tmp files</li>
<li>automate common tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing a deployment from scratch is useful in making sure that if a
new developer comes on, he can bootstrap the app.  I like writing new
automation tasks only after I notice the tasks being repetitive.  It's
good not to do this all the time and cut into development time.</p>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Releasely</h2><a id="user-content-releasely" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Releasely" href="#releasely"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<p>Do these tasks <em>before</em> you actually overwrite your current production
codebase with new code.</p>
<ul>
<li>tag codebase</li>
<li>test rigorously in staging</li>
<li>backup code, data</li>
<li>run sanity test of data</li>
<li>run regression tests</li>
</ul>
<div class="markdown-heading"><h2 class="heading-element">Quarterly</h2><a id="user-content-quarterly" class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Quarterly" href="#quarterly"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a></div>
<ul>
<li>see if there are worthwhile tech stack upgrades - web server, libraries, database, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It's easy to stick with a working system and keep developing off on
top of an understood foundtain.  However, in doing so, you might be
missing out on some really useful innovations that have been released.
For Coupa, we don't slot in infrastructure and tech stack projects
into every release, but we do upgrade Rails and Passenger every other
stable release or so.  Keeping up with your programming community
helps you and your project stay up to date on the latest security and
performance problems.</p>
<p>I think all my guidelines are common sense items that good development
teams already do.  What worries me is that there isn't a good
convention about <em>how often</em> these tasks are done.  After all, it's
much easier to check for problems when the maintenance light comes on,
rather than to wait for your engine to fall out.</p>
