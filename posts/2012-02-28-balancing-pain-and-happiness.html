<p><em>Republished from <a href="http://blog.opperator.com">Opperator blog</a></em></p>

<p>When building a product for your audience, you need to empathize with their
pains and problems. It's one thing to imagine yourself in their proverbial
shoes, but it's much more effective to just wear the same damn shoes. It means
using your own product while you're building your product. Startup slang
commonly refers to this as "dog-fooding", but I dislike this term because it
evokes images of being forced fed something you don't want.</p>

<p>While it's important to focus on relieving your customers' pain, it's equally
important to optimize your own happiness along the way. Not only will you
enjoy your work more, your code will be "happier" as well. Allow me to
explain what happy code looks like.</p>

<p>When Michael and I started <a href="http://opperator.com">Opperator</a>, we aligned
ourselves with our customers. When life sucks for our customers, life sucks
for us. When life is awesome for our customers, life is also awesome for us.
It's a very simple formula to balance: remove sucky things, and increase
awesome things. Simple as this sounds, many entrepreneurs only tackle the
former half of the formula. For any startup, there are many things that happen
behind the scenes that your customers don't see. Things like code smells,
technical debt, and shoddy documentation. But just because your customers
don't see these things, doesn't mean that you don't.</p>

<p>We execute quickly on Opperator, but we also take the time to step back and
holistically evaluate our product.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are we happy with the direction we're going?</li>
<li>Are we happy with the code we've written?</li>
<li>Do we feel mentally or physically burned out?</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren't things that your customer will see. But over time, these things
will add up. If you're not happy with working on your product, then your
efforts will be forced, and the results will reflect this. Taking a small
slice of time to take care of any of these points will yield long term results
for your business and for yourself.</p>
