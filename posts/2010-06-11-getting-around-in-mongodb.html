I started working with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org" rel="nofollow">MongoDB</a> a few days
ago.  To oversimplify, think of Mongo as a really big and fast hash
that gets saved to disk. It lets you query, retrieve, and manipulate
data in Javascript and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" rel="nofollow">JSON</a>.  I
had a ton of work to do, so I didn't get a chance to explore the
technology as much as I would've liked.  Today, after getting a solid
night's sleep, I got a chance to experiment more.  Read on to get some
quick tips about writing Mongo queries and generating reports from the
Mongo shell.</p>
<p>When I first started interacting with Mongo, I used the Ruby
<a href="http://mongoid.org/" rel="nofollow">Mongoid</a> adapter.  It gave me a familiar
ActiveRecord interface so I could accomplish things like:</p>
<pre><code>Beer.all(:conditions =&gt; { :style =&gt; "stout" })
</code></pre>
<p>But it also gave me a sneak peak at Mongo's 'criteria' API for querying</p>
<pre><code>Beer.criteria.where(:style =&gt; "stout")
</code></pre>
<p>It's worthwhile to note that criterias are lazily loaded, meaning
that the query isn't performed until you actually need to access the
data.</p>
<pre><code>Beer.criteria.where(:style =&gt; "stout")  # doesn't hit mongo
Beer.criteria.where(:style =&gt; "stout").first.drink!  # executes actual query
</code></pre>
<p>This was all fine and dandy, but just like learning SQL and
ActiveRecord, having an understanding of the underlying system gives
you a better idea of what you can do.  So I busted out the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Overview+-+The+MongoDB+Interactive+Shell" rel="nofollow">mongo
shell</a>
and started running queries.  The
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Tutorial#Tutorial" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> was
a good starting point for familiarizing myself with how to connect to
mongo, executing some queries, and printing out results.  My favorite
feature was that the mongo shell doubled as a Javascript interpreter.
I was able to write JS to manipulate the query results:</p>
<pre><code>function map(arr, func) {
  var collection = [];
  if(arr &amp;&amp; arr.length) {
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
      collection.push(func(arr[i]));
    }
  }
  return collection;
}

db.beers.find().forEach(function(beer) {
  print(beer.name);
  print('--------------');
  map(beer.ingredients, function(ingredient) {
    print(beer.ingredient.quantity + ' - ' + beer.ingredient.name);
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>I got pretty tired of copying and pasting this script every time I
edited it.  Thankfully, mongo shell lets you pass in script files to
execute:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mongo --help
MongoDB shell version: 1.4.0
usage: mongo [options] [db address] [file names (ending in .js)
</code></pre>
<p>This little feature enabled me to write more complex scripts and tweak
to my heart's content.  Something was still missing though.  I love
Javascript as a language, but nowadays, I've grown so accustomed to
jQuery that I'll start typing jQuery assuming it's available even when
it's not.</p>
<pre><code>db.beers.find().forEach(function(beer) {
  // CURSES! JQuery isn't available :(
  $(beer.ingredients).each(function() {
    // ... do something
  });
})
</code></pre>
<p>My next genius idea: load jQuery as the first script:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mongo beerdb jquery-1.4.2.min.js reporting.js
JS Error: ReferenceError: window is not defined jquery-1.4.2.min.js:153
failed to load: jquery-1.4.2.min.js
</code></pre>
<p>Noooooo! It makes a lot of sense that jQuery would assume a browser
environment, but I was hoping that it wouldn't require it for the nice
utility functions.</p>
<p>To get the job done, I wrote myself a small utility library:</p>
<pre><code>$ = {
  // &gt; $.map([1,2,3,4], function(x) { return x*x; }
  // [1,4,9,16]
  map: function(arr, func) {
    var collection = [];
    if(arr &amp;&amp; arr.length) {
      for(var i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++) {
        collection.push(func(arr[i]));
      }
    }
    return collection;
  },

  // &gt; $.max([1,2,3,4])
  // 4
  // &gt; $.max([1,2,3,4], function(x) { return x*2; })
  // 8
  max: function(arr, func) {
    if(arr == undefined) { return arr; }
    var max = null;
    for(var i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++) {
      var current = (func ? func(arr[i]) : arr[i]);
      max = (current &gt; max ? current : max);
    }
    return max;
  },
}
</code></pre>
<p>This didn't buy me the full power of JQuery, but at the same time, I
was pretty happy I was able to quickly whip together some JS and get
the reports I needed.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a JS library that buys you a lot of core library
features and fixes, but doesn't assume a browser?  I looked at <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/bringing-the-browser-to-the-server/" rel="nofollow">John
Resig's
Env.js</a>,
but even that assumes that you're running JS in
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" rel="nofollow">Rhino</a>.  What other Mongo tricks do
people find useful?</p>

<p>Here's the order I recommend reading the Mongo documentation.  The
Advanced Queries link was especially useful.</p>
