<p>I spent the weekend migrating from my shared hosting at Dreamhost over
to VPS hosting at <a href="http://www.silverrack.com/" rel="nofollow">SilverRack</a>.  In the
move, I setup my housing app to run on postgresql instead of mysql.  I
was in for a few surprises though.</p>
<p>When I ran db:migrate, I got a strange error:</p>
<pre><code> rake aborted!
 No such file or directory - /tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432
</code></pre>
<p>At first I thought it was because postgres wasn't started, but that
didn't make sense because I had another terminal with psql running
just fine.  If you follow the --trace message, you'll find that the
most poorly named option in database.yml will fix this problem:</p>
<pre><code> production:
   adapter: postgresql
   # ... other stuff
   host: /var/run/postgresql
</code></pre>
<p>The 'host' parameter is the directory Rails looks in to get the tmp
file to determine how to connect to postgres.  I guess in other *nix
systems this is conventionally in tmp, but that's not true for Debian
based distros.</p>
<p>After fixing that, I ran into another little problem:</p>
<pre><code>psql: FATAL:  Ident authentication failed for user "xxx"
</code></pre>
<p>This one comes as a result of good defaults by the Debian postgresql
configs.  A <a href="http://semweb.weblog.ub.rug.nl/node/61" rel="nofollow">quick google</a>
solved this one:</p>
<pre><code># add to pg_hba.conf, found in /etc/postgresql/...
local    all   all   trust
host     all   127.0.0.1  255.255.255.255    trust
</code></pre>

back</a>.</p>
