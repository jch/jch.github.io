<p>One of my favorite plugins I've seen so far is
<a href="http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/acts_as_state_machine" rel="nofollow">acts_as_state_machine</a>.
It's a dead simple way to model the different states your models can be
in.  It also lets you register callbacks to when a model enters,
entered, or leaves a particular state.  It's absolutely fantasic until
I have to test it.  Then it becomes an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>The first intuitive, but horrifically wrong idea is to stub out the
current state:</p>
<pre><code>@model.stub!(:state).and_return('old_state')
@model.some_event!
@model.state.should == 'new_state'
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this is the mock will always return old_state, even
if some_event! caused @model to go into new_state.</p>
<p>A less intuitive, but workable solution is to check that the
transition event was fired:</p>
<pre><code>@model.should_receive(:update_attribute).with(@model.class.state_column, "matched")
</code></pre>
<p>This is a little nicer, but kind of obscures the intention of the
test.  So ideally, I'd like to be able to say something like:</p>
<pre><code>@model.should transition_to('matched').from('draft')
</code></pre>
<p>Thankfully, the crappy RSpec documentation does cover this case.  It
was easy to write a <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/rdoc/classes/Spec/Matchers.html" rel="nofollow">custom expection
matcher</a>:</p>
<pre><code>module ActsAsStateMachineMatchers
  class Transition
    def initialize(expected)
      @expected = expected
    end

    def matches?(target)
      @target = target
      @target.should_receive(:update_attribute).
        with(@target.class.state_column, @expected)
    end

    def failure_message
      &lt;&lt;-MSG
      expected #{@target.inspect} to transition to state
      #{@expected}, but in state {@target.state}
      MSG
    end

    def negative_failure_message
      &lt;&lt;-MSG
      expected #{@target.inspect} to transition to state
      #{@expected}, but in state {@target.state}
      MSG
    end
  end

  def transition_to_state(expected)
    Transition.new(expected)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is one step away from my ideal case because I was too lazy to a
Spec::Mocks::Methods with a corresponding
Spec::Mocks::MessageExpectation, which is what 'should_receive' and
'with' are.  If I ever get unlazy enough to poke into the code more, I
could write the analogous 'should_transition_to', and 'from'.  This
might be a good excuse to open a github account and play with that too
