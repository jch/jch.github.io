<p>I really couldn't help myself with this one.  Someone gave me the
privledge to play around with their pet project, and the first thing I
thought of was to read the HTML, and write a bash loop to spew all
over it.  We both got a kick out of it.</p>
<p>The end result is both hilarious, and kind of artsy too.  I think it
greatly encapsulates my <em>feelings</em> towards input validation.</p>
