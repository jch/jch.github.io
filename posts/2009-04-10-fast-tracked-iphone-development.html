<p>Jumping into a new language, a new framework, and a new set of tools
is overwhelming!  But the best way to learn is to be utterly crushed
by the technology, then have friends pick up the pieces.  Once you've
seen a good broad overview of what's available, you're more capable of
finding resources on your own.  Here is my chronological step by step
guide to getting bootstrapped.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-ready" class="anchor" href="#ready" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ready...</h2>

<p>I don't have an iPhone (yet).  One criteria for me to buy the iPhone
is whether developing for the device is fun.  You'd think this would
prevent me from developing, but Apple's iPhone SDK includes an
emulator.  The SDK is a huge, so start downloading <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

<p><em>1 hour+</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/">Download the iPhone SDK</a> and install it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-set" class="anchor" href="#set" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Set...</h2>

<p>While you wait, check out Apple's video overviews.  They're really
slim on technical content, but help familiarize you with how the
frameworks are organized.  I read the documents with the videos
playing the in background.  The videos are too slow paced to watch by
themselves.</p>

<p><em>2 hour chunks until your brain goes numb</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/navigation/GettingStarted.html">Getting Started Documents</a></li>
<li><a href="https://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/BrowsePrivately/adc.apple.com.1479953497">Getting Started Videos</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After you get sick of the market-speak hype, familiarize yourself with
the patterns and concepts behind Objective-C and the Cocoa framework.</p>

<p><em>3 hours</em></p>

</ul>

<p>Understanding the lifecycle of an iPhone application can help you
understand how the different pieces of an app fits together.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-go" class="anchor" href="#go" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Go!</h2>

<p>Watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of documents is a good
start, but it really doesn't stick until you apply it.  At this point,
I had to struggle with the language, the framework, Xcode, and
Interface Builder.  To keep your sanity, I recommend working through
Apple's sample projects.  If you get bored, I recommend flipping
through <a href="http://www.appsamuck.com/">Appsamuck</a> for some good examples.</p>

<p>I'm very lucky to have my iPhone gurus Mike, Stephen, and Allen on
hand to teach me best practices and tips and tricks as I go along.  If
anyone feels like doing a hack session for a few hours on weeknights,
ping me at jch at this domain.  I'll update this post with more useful
bootstrapping links as I go along.</p>
