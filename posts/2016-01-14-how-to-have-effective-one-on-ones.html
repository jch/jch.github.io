<p>I have half hour weekly one on one meetings with my manager, Dave. We usually
talk about work, life, and career goals. Before these meetings, I felt
uncomfortable to give or ask for feedback without implying something was wrong.
These regular and short meetings also allow us to highlight achievements, and to
bring up small concerns before they grow into large ones.</p>

<p>Although we meet regularly, here are a few things I do to make the most of these
meetings.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-write-an-agenda" class="anchor" href="#write-an-agenda" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Write an agenda</h2>

<p>Before each meeting, I spend roughly 15 minutes preparing a simple bullet point
list of topics I want to cover. This agenda gives Dave a preview, and a chance
to gather relevant information. It's also useful during the meeting as an
outline. I usually include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a review last week's meeting</li>
<li>high level accomplishments</li>
<li>recognition for team members that are doing a great job</li>
<li>questions</li>
<li>reminders about upcoming events</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-take-notes" class="anchor" href="#take-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Take notes</h2>

<p>I like to jot down notes as we talk. I write down things I find useful or want
to think about after the meeting. Some examples include feedback about ways I
can improve, feedback about how my manager could make my project run smoother,
and things that are happening outside of my project that's relevant to my
interests. It's a good time to discover new projects and opportunities. I find
that the agenda will often trigger us to share bits of useful information that
would've otherwise gone unmentioned.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-call-out-action-items" class="anchor" href="#call-out-action-items" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Call out action items</h2>

<p>Before we end a meeting, we talk about things that need follow up. It could be
an idea that needs more research, or it could be coordinating schedules for a
team offsite. Whatever these may be, we decide who is responsible, and when it
needs to be done.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-review-and-follow-up" class="anchor" href="#review-and-follow-up" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Review and follow up</h2>

<p>After each meeting, I dump my notes into a email reply for review at the
following meeting. Dedicated review time is great because we know we'll revisit
things the following week, so there's no need to waste brain cycles worrying
during the week.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-build-a-relationship" class="anchor" href="#build-a-relationship" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build a relationship</h2>

<p>Dave and I have gotten to know each other better through these one on ones. Even
with an agenda, they feel casual and easy going. We live in different cities, so
most of our meetings happen over video chat, but when we are in the same place,
we like to do go for a walk or have a chat over coffee.</p>

<p>Learning about the other person's goals and background subtly shapes our
interactions. Over time, we build up our trust in each other, and become more
effective in our day to day work. We get a better sense of the other person's
communication styles, and also what they're looking for.</p>

<h2>
<a id="user-content-better-one-on-ones" class="anchor" href="#better-one-on-ones" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Better one on ones</h2>

<p>It's easy to take one on ones for granted. But with some attention and care,
effective one on ones are a great tool for your career. Agendas and notes keeps
everyone focused, while review and follow up prevents things from being
forgotten or neglected. Over time, these meetings become an open and safe place
to talk about long term goals.</p>
