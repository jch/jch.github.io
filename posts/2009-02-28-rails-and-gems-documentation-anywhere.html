<p><a href="/images/mobile-me.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/mobile-me.png" alt="stick figure of me and macbook" style="max-width:100%;"></a> A great thing about
<a href="http://www.coupa.com/">Coupa</a> work is how I can hack it up without a
network connection.  The codebase is checked out and I run mysql
locally.  I fire up emacs and a script/server and I'm pretty much good
to go.  The only downside is not being able to access the rails and
gems docs.  Here's what I did to put together a productive local
setup.</p>

  Seifer</a>
  of RailsEnvy does a better job of explaining the process than I do.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the rest of this guide, I'm going to assume you have
ruby and gem installed via MacPorts.  If they aren't, change the
directories in the commands appropriately.</p>

<a id="user-content-gems" class="anchor" href="#gems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gems</h2>

<p>First of all, let's generate the documentation for all of your
gems. If you're more accustomed to the layout of Rails documentation,
then install <a href="/files/rdoc_template.rb">Jamis's rdoc template</a>.</p>

<pre><code># this step is optional
cd /opt/local/lib/ruby/1.8/rdoc/generators/template/html
sudo mv html html.original.rb
sudo curl -o html.rb http://www.whatcodecraves.com/posts/2009/02/28/rails_and_gems_documentation_anywhere/rdoc_template.rb
</code></pre>

<p>(The link to the original template was broken for me.)</p>

<p>Now actually generate the rdocs.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem rdoc --all
</code></pre>

<p>After the command finishes, start a gem server so you can browse the
docs:</p>

<pre><code>gem server --daemon
</code></pre>

<p>Point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:8088">the gem server</a>.</p>

<a id="user-content-rails" class="anchor" href="#rails" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rails</h2>

<p>You'll notice that no rdocs were generated for the Rails gem. This is
because the rdoc task is intended to be run from the root of a frozen
Rails app.  This is amazingly annoying, but is a <a href="http://www.nullislove.com/2007/05/29/rails-documentation/">solved
problem</a>.
Basically, you have to freeze Rails in your app, rdoc it, unfreeze it,
and copy over the rdocs.</p>

<pre><code>cd myapp
rake rails:freeze:gems
rake doc:rails
rake rails:unfreeze
sudo cp -R doc/api/ /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/doc/rails-2.1.1/rdoc/
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can code from anywhere!  As an added bonus, the docs will load
blazingly fast.</p>
