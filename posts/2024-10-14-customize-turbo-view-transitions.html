<p>View transitions became available in Safari 18. Turbo had support for this, and the default experience is great in other browsers. There's a small hiccup that the default iOS and Safari browser back/forward swipe navigation animations cannot be disabled, leading to a double animation:</p>

<p>The intuitive turbo lifecycle callback to fix this would be to customize <code>turbo:before-render</code>. However, that's too late in the lifecycle. Instead, the fix was to conditionally disable view transitions on swipe gesture navigation by removing the view-transition meta tag in <code>turbo:before-cache</code>.

Safari has the least friendly progressive web app experience, but I'm using it for my personal project. Hope this helps you in yours.</p>
